# Tissue explant project

## Objectives
In the field of personal health threatment, one research technic consist of spreading differant tissue sample of the same tumor biopsy accross different substrats with some unique threatment in order to asses their efficiency. The goal of this project was to automatise this selection and storage in indiidual tubes of the samples in order to make it faster and more accurate.

## Hardware
The project use the frame from a 3D printer, an anycubic mega zero eith it's controller. A webcam is used in order to detect and track the samples and a dynamixel xl430 is used to actuate a micro-pipette in order to act like a pneumatic gripper.

## Computer vision
One of the main constraint of this project was to be able to detect and select the tissue samples. The webcam placed at the end effector of the robot makes it possible. The camera gives the position of the particles and it is also used to check if the samples are correctly picked up by the tip of the pipette.

## Results 
comming soon...

# Tissue explant project

## Objectives
In the context of tumor research, personalized medical treatments are very expensive and not widely accessible. One aspect of the research involves isolating samples from a biopsy to test several treatments on the same tumor. This project aims to develop a robotic platform capable of selecting, moving, and culturing these different samples to streamline the resulting research and make the technique more affordable.

## Hardware


The project use the frame from a 3D printer, an anycubic mega zero with it's controller. A webcam is used in order to detect and track the samples and three dynamixel xl430 are used to actuate two micro-pipette in order to act like a pneumatic gripper and to automate the manipulation of liquids..
The next illustrations represent the frame of the robot, the end effextor with the camera and the two pipette tips and the actuation of the pipette.

## Computer vision
One of the main constraint of this project was to be able to detect and select the tissue samples. The webcam placed at the end effector of the robot makes it possible. The camera gives the position of the particles and it is also used to check if the samples are correctly picked up by the tip of the pipette.
